## swagger-doc-gen-cli
Dynamically generate a OpenAPI specification file from your express app that can be used along with the swagger UI package to create your api documentation. 

<br/>
This relieves the developer from creating a spec with thousands of lines. This package generates majority of the specification, the only part that needs to be filled in is the request and response body format for your API endpoints
